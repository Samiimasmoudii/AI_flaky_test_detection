TEST 00 Summary: The developer's fix addresses a potential flakiness source related to the Keras backend and optimizer import path, which can affect model serialization and deserialization. The alternative fix improves temporary file handling robustness but may not have been the specific cause of flakiness in this ML model save/load test.

This is a valid technique for *that type* of flakiness, but is completely unrelated to the developer's fix, which addresses setting up a network client (`UdpClient`).
