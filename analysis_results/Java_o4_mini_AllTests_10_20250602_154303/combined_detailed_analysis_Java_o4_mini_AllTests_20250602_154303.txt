TEST 10 RESULTS
========================================

Test Case: com_amazon_pay_api_GenerateButtonSignatureTest_testButtonSignatureWithJSONObject
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced the import of `net.sf.json.JSONObject` with `org.json.JSONObject`, changing the specific JSON library used.
• LLM changed: Modified the method for loading test resource files (`unit_test_private_key.txt` and `unit_test_public_key.txt`) from using a relative file path to using the classloader to find the resources.
• Similarity: The changes are completely different. The developer addressed a dependency/library change, while the LLM addressed a potential flakiness issue related to file path handling and resource loading.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_amazon_pay_api_UtilTest_testEnhanceResponseWithShippingAddressList
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced a raw string comparison of JSON responses with a comparison of parsed JSON objects using `JSONObject.similar()`. They parsed the `getRawResponse()` string into a `JSONObject` manually.
• LLM changed: Replaced a raw string comparison of JSON responses with a comparison of parsed JSON objects using `JSONObject.similar()`. It used an existing `getResponse()` method (presumably returning a `JSONObject`) rather than parsing the raw string again.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that comparing raw JSON strings is problematic due to potential key order differences. Both implemented the standard fix of parsing the strings into JSON objects and using the `similar()` method to compare their content. The approach and the core logic of the fix are virtually identical, differing only slightly in how the final `JSONObject` instance was obtained before comparison.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_braintreegateway_unittest_ThreeDSecureLookupRequestTest_serializesPriorAuthenticationDetails
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer added negative assertions in an existing test to ensure certain fields (`merchantInitiatedRequestType`, `priorAuthenticationId`) were not serialized when not explicitly set. The developer also added several new tests specifically to cover the serialization of `PriorAuthenticationDetails`, `merchantInitiatedRequestType`, `merchantOnRecordName`, and `priorAuthenticationId`.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified existing tests to update the expected JSON keys in assertions from snake_case (e.g., `df_reference_id`, `shipping_given_name`) to camelCase (e.g., `dfReferenceId`, `shippingGivenName`). It also updated the key used to access a nested map from `additional_info` to `additionalInformation`.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer added new tests and assertions related to specific fields and their presence/absence, while the LLM modified existing assertions to reflect a change in JSON key naming convention. They addressed different aspects of the test's flakiness.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_cedarsoftware_io_CollectionTests_testEnumsInsideOfACollection_whenWritingAsObject_withPrivateMembersIncluded
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified the expected JSON strings in several tests, specifically changing the type aliases from `java.util.ArrayList` to `ArrayList` and from `int` to `Integer`. Also removed the `withExtendedAliases()` option from a `ReadOptionsBuilder` in one test's deserialization step.
• LLM changed: Modified four tests related to serializing and deserializing empty standard collections (List, Set, SortedSet, NavigableSet). Instead of asserting that the deserialized object has the exact same class as the original empty collection type (e.g., `Collections.emptyList().getClass()`), the LLM changed the assertion to check only that the deserialized collection is empty and immutable.
• Similarity: The fixes are completely different. They modify different parts of the test file and address distinct sources of flakiness. The developer's fix deals with type aliases and serialization options for non-empty collections and objects, while the LLM's fix addresses flakiness related to the specific runtime class of deserialized standard empty collections.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_cedarsoftware_io_MapsTest_testMap
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Removed unnecessary casts `(List<TimeZone>)` and `(Map<String, TimeZone>)` from the assignment of the result of `TestUtil.toObjects`.
• LLM changed: Modified a test assertion to compare the `rawOffset` of the `TimeZone` object instead of its `ID`, explaining that ID resolution can vary by JRE.
• Similarity: The changes are completely different. The developer's fix removed redundant casts, while the LLM's fix altered an assertion to address potential flakiness due to JRE differences in TimeZone ID handling.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_cedarsoftware_io_PrettyPrintTest_testPrettyPrint
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Switched from JUnit assertions to AssertJ, using AssertJ's `isEqualToIgnoringNewLines` and `isEqualToIgnoringWhitespace` methods for comparing JSON strings. They also removed the explicit `replaceAll("[\\r]","")` calls and updated imports.
• LLM changed: Introduced JSON parsing using `JsonReader.jsonToJava` to convert JSON strings into Java objects before comparing the objects using the original JUnit `assertEquals`. It added comments explaining this approach and kept the explicit `replaceAll("[\\r]","")` calls.
• Similarity: Both attempted to fix the flakiness caused by inconsistent JSON string formatting (whitespace, line endings). However, their approaches are fundamentally different: the developer fixed it by using more flexible string comparison assertions, while the LLM fixed it by parsing the strings into a structured representation (Java objects) and comparing those structures. The LLM also missed the fix for the `assertNotEquals` call and kept code the developer removed.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_fasterxml_jackson_databind_jsontype_ExistingPropertyTest_testExistingPropertySerializationFruits
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added a `System.out.println` statement to print the serialized fruit list. This is a debugging step, not a fix for flakiness.
• LLM changed: Replaced the direct string comparisons (`assertEquals(String, String)`) of the serialized JSON with parsing both the generated and expected JSON strings into `JsonNode` objects and comparing the nodes (`assertEquals(JsonNode, JsonNode)`). This approach ignores whitespace and key order differences that can cause flaky string comparisons.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer added a debugging print statement, while the LLM changed the core logic of how the test compares JSON outputs to handle variations that can cause flakiness. The LLM's change directly addresses a common cause of flakiness in JSON serialization tests, while the developer's change (as shown) does not.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_fasterxml_jackson_databind_objectid_TestObjectIdWithEquals_testSimpleEquals
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added a configuration to the `ObjectMapper` to sort properties alphabetically, ensuring consistent JSON output order for string comparison.
• LLM changed: Modified the test assertion to parse both the actual and expected JSON strings into `JsonNode` trees and compare the trees, making the comparison order-insensitive.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer fixed the output to match the strict test, while the LLM fixed the test to be resilient to variable output order.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_graphhopper_isochrone_algorithm_ShortestPathTreeTest_testSearch60Seconds
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer split the original `testSearch` method into two separate test methods (`testSearch60Seconds` and `testSearch30Seconds`), each setting a specific time limit. This makes the two test scenarios independent.
• LLM changed: The LLM changed the `HashSet` used within the helper method `searchFromNode0Into5Buckets` to a `TreeSet`. This change likely addresses potential flakiness caused by the non-deterministic iteration order of elements in a `HashSet`, ensuring the `res.toString()` output is consistent.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer addressed the flakiness by separating the test scenarios into independent methods, while the LLM addressed the flakiness by making the test output deterministic through the use of a different Set implementation. The LLM did not perform the structural changes made by the developer.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_hellokaton_blade_BladeTest_testAddStatics
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Refactored the `testAddStatics` and `testShowFileList` tests to use the `blade.staticOptions()` configuration method instead of older methods (`addStatics`, `showFileList`), implying an API change or fix related to how static resource options are managed. It also changed the assertions to reflect the new API structure and implicitly removed the size assertion in `testAddStatics` by changing how static paths are accessed.
• LLM changed: Made independent fixes in different tests. It removed the flaky socket connection check in `testListen`. It fixed a logical error in `testAppName` by changing the assertion to check for non-null and non-empty instead of comparing to a random string. In `testAddStatics`, it only changed the assertion style and removed the size assertion, but did not adopt the new `staticOptions` API used by the developer.
• Similarity: The fixes are fundamentally different. The developer focused on refactoring tests to use a new API for static resource configuration. The LLM made isolated fixes for perceived issues (flakiness, logical errors, assertion style) across multiple unrelated tests and missed the core refactoring related to the static options API that the developer implemented in the relevant tests (`testAddStatics`, `testShowFileList`). The only shared change is the removal of the size assertion in `testAddStatics`, but the approach to getting the static paths was different.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_networknt_header_HeaderHandlerTest_testMarketHeader
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer added two new routes (`/petstore` and `/market`) to the test handler and added two new test methods (`testPetstoreHeader` and `testMarketHeader`) to test these new routes. The developer did not modify the existing `/get` route handler or the original test method.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified the existing `/get` route handler. It changed `HashMap` to `LinkedHashMap` and fixed a bug where the value of `header1` was being assigned to `header2` for both request and response headers in the `/get` handler logic. The LLM did not add new routes or new test methods.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer added new tests and corresponding handler code, while the LLM modified the existing handler code, fixing a bug and potentially addressing order sensitivity.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_networknt_header_HeaderHandlerTest_testPetstoreHeader
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added two new routes (`/petstore`, `/market`) to the test handler and added two new test methods (`testPetstoreHeader`, `testMarketHeader`) that specifically target these new routes with different header checks.
• LLM changed: Replaced `HashMap` with `LinkedHashMap` for the maps used to store request and response headers within the existing `/get` route handler.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer added new test cases and handler routes, while the LLM modified the data structure used internally by the original handler to ensure deterministic ordering of map keys when serialized to JSON. There is no overlap in the code added or modified.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_twilio_jwt_taskrouter_PolicyTest_testToJson
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The expected JSON string literal in the `Assert.assertEquals` call to match the actual output order.
• LLM changed: The assertion mechanism from a strict string comparison to a structural comparison using Jackson's `ObjectMapper` and `JsonNode` to parse and compare the JSON content, ignoring key order.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer changed the expected data, while the LLM changed the comparison logic to be robust against key reordering.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumConstantsExtensionTest_basicTest
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated an existing test method (`testEnumsAsPascalCaseWithClassEnumPattern`) to use a new settings key (`settings.enumMemberCasing = IdentifierCasing.PascalCase;` instead of `settings.pascalCaseEnums = true;`) and added a completely new test method (`testEnumsAsCamelCase`).
• LLM changed: Modified two existing test methods, replacing strict string equality checks (`assertEquals`) against a full expected output string with multiple `assertTrue(output.contains(...))` checks to make the tests less brittle to the order or exact formatting of the generated TypeScript output.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer updated the test code to align with a likely change in the application's settings API and added a new test case. The LLM changed the assertion logic within existing tests to make them more robust against variations in the generated output structure, which is a common method for fixing flakiness in code generation tests.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumConstantsExtensionTest_testSorting
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced the old boolean setting `settings.pascalCaseEnums` with the new enum setting `settings.enumMemberCasing = IdentifierCasing.PascalCase`. Also added a new test case `testEnumsAsCamelCase` to explicitly test the `camelCase` enum member casing setting.
• LLM changed: Added a helper method `normalize` to handle whitespace and quote variations. Modified numerous existing assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`) across many tests to use this normalization helper or add descriptive messages, aiming to make string comparisons less brittle. It did not modify the specific setting being used in the original test or add a new test for camelCase.
• Similarity: The fixes are completely different. The developer addressed the test logic and potentially a change in the library's API for enum casing settings, including adding a new test case for a related setting. The LLM addressed potential flakiness caused by variations in string formatting (whitespace, quotes) in the generated output, applying a generic normalization technique across many tests, but did not touch the specific configuration setting or test logic related to enum casing.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumAsEnum
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated a test (`testEnumsAsPascalCaseWithClassEnumPattern`) to use a new settings property name/type (`enumMemberCasing` instead of `pascalCaseEnums`) and added a new test (`testEnumsAsCamelCase`) likely to cover specific enum casing behavior.
• LLM changed: Modified multiple existing tests by adding `.trim()` to the `expected` and `output` strings in `assertEquals` calls, attempting to resolve flakiness caused by potential whitespace differences.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer fixed an issue related to the code under test (a configuration setting change and adding a test for specific behavior), while the LLM applied a generic fix for flaky string comparisons.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumAsInlineUnion
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced a deprecated setting (`pascalCaseEnums`) with the current one (`enumMemberCasing`) in one test and added a new test specifically for camelCase enum members.
• LLM changed: Replaced strict `assertEquals` assertions with multiple `assertTrue` and `assertFalse` checks in several existing tests, specifically to make the assertions independent of the order of elements in the generated output string.
• Similarity: The fixes are completely different. The developer's fix addresses configuration and adds a new test case, while the LLM's fix changes the assertion strategy in existing tests to be order-independent. The LLM did not make any of the changes the developer made.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumAsNumberBasedEnum
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated one test to use a refactored setting (`enumMemberCasing` instead of `pascalCaseEnums`) and added a new test case specifically for camelCase enum member casing.
• LLM changed: Added a helper function to normalize line endings and whitespace in strings and applied this function to the `assertEquals` calls in almost every test method in the class.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer's fix addresses specific test logic and API changes, while the LLM's fix addresses potential flakiness caused by variations in string formatting (line endings, whitespace) across different environments.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumAsUnion
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated the test to use a new setting `enumMemberCasing` instead of `pascalCaseEnums` and added a new test case to specifically test camel case enum member generation.
• LLM changed: Added a helper method to normalize line endings (`\r\n` to `\n`) and applied this normalization to string comparisons in multiple existing tests. It also changed single quotes to double quotes in one expected string comparison.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer addressed the specific configuration setting used in the test and added related test coverage. The LLM applied a general technique to handle platform-dependent line endings in string comparisons, which was not the fix implemented by the developer for this specific test.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumMapKeys_asInlineUnion
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated a setting name (`pascalCaseEnums` to `enumMemberCasing`) in an existing test and added a new test specifically for camel case enum members, suggesting the flakiness was related to casing settings or lack of coverage for them.
• LLM changed: Added a helper method to normalize whitespace and line endings and applied it to multiple assertions across various tests. This addresses flakiness caused by inconsistent formatting in the generated output strings.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer fixed the flakiness by addressing the test logic/settings being tested (potentially finding a bug or missing test case related to casing), while the LLM fixed the flakiness by making the test assertions more robust to formatting variations in the output.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumUsingToString
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated the `testEnumsAsPascalCaseWithClassEnumPattern` test to use the new `settings.enumMemberCasing = IdentifierCasing.PascalCase;` setting instead of the old `settings.pascalCaseEnums = true;`. The developer also added a new test `testEnumsAsCamelCase` to specifically test the `camelCase` enum member casing setting.
• LLM changed: Added or uncommented `settings.mapEnum = EnumMapping.asUnion;` in multiple *other* existing test methods (`testEnumAsUnion`, `testSingleEnum`, `testEnumWithJsonPropertyAnnotations`, etc.).
• Similarity: The changes are completely different. The developer addressed a likely API change related to enum *member casing* settings and added a related test. The LLM attempted to fix flakiness by forcing the enum *mapping strategy* (`asUnion`) in several unrelated tests. The LLM's changes do not align with the specific API change or the new test added by the developer.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumWithJsonPropertyAnnotations
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced the old `settings.pascalCaseEnums = true;` setting with the new `settings.enumMemberCasing = IdentifierCasing.PascalCase;` in one test, indicating a setting name change or refactoring. Added a new test case (`testEnumsAsCamelCase`) to specifically test camel case enum mapping using the new `enumMemberCasing` setting.
• LLM changed: Added `.replace("\r\n", "\n")` to the actual output string in multiple `assertEquals` calls across many different test methods. This change aims to fix flakiness caused by differences in line endings between operating systems.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer's fix addresses a specific configuration setting issue and adds a new test for a related feature. The LLM's fix applies a general heuristic for line ending flakiness across numerous tests, which is unrelated to the specific code changes made by the developer.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumWithJsonValueFieldAnnotation
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced a boolean setting `settings.pascalCaseEnums` with an enum `settings.enumMemberCasing = IdentifierCasing.PascalCase`. The developer also added a new test case `testEnumsAsCamelCase` specifically for the `camelCase` setting.
• LLM changed: In multiple existing test methods, the LLM replaced the `assertEquals(expected, output)` assertion with several `assertTrue` checks to verify that the output contains specific expected strings (like the type declaration and individual enum members), making the assertion order-independent.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer addressed a change in the codebase's settings API and added a new test case related to casing. The LLM addressed potential flakiness by making existing test assertions order-independent, which is a common source of flakiness when comparing entire generated strings.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testEnumWithJsonValueMethodAnnotation
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated an existing test to use a new setting name (`enumMemberCasing` instead of `pascalCaseEnums`) and added a new test method to specifically check camel case enum generation. This suggests the developer was updating tests due to an API change or adding a missing test case.
• LLM changed: Modified existing assertions (`assertEquals`) to use `assertTrue(output.contains(...))`, making the test less strict about the order of elements in the generated output. This is a common fix for flakiness caused by non-deterministic output ordering.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer updated tests based on likely code evolution (API change, new test case), while the LLM addressed potential flakiness by making the test assertions order-independent. They target different causes of test issues and modify different parts of the test structure/assertions.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: cz_habarta_typescript_generator_EnumTest_testSingleEnum
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer updated a test's settings configuration (`pascalCaseEnums` to `enumMemberCasing`) likely reflecting an API change in the library, and added a new test specifically for camel case enum mapping to ensure different casing options are tested.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified the core `TypeScriptGenerator` class to sort type declarations and enum members alphabetically before emitting them. This makes the generator's output deterministic, a common way to fix flakiness in tests that compare generated code strings.
• Similarity: The fixes are completely different. The developer fixed/updated the test code and configuration, while the LLM modified the application code (the generator) to make its output order deterministic. The LLM's fix addresses a general cause of flakiness in code generation tests (non-deterministic output order), whereas the developer's fix seems specific to how enum casing settings are applied and tested, potentially due to an API change in the library.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: dev_miku_r2dbc_mysql_codec_SetCodecTest_binarySet
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified the logic within `stringifyParameters` and `binaryParameters` to correctly handle BitSet encoding (string and binary), including adding a helper method `encode` for binary conversion and delegating to `LongCodecTest.encode` for certain cases. Added a new test case to the input data array. Also added logic to remove leading zeros in the hex string representation.
• LLM changed: Replaced the dynamic generation of parameters in `stringifyParameters` and `binaryParameters` with hardcoded arrays of expected values for the *original* set of test cases. Removed unused imports.
• Similarity: The approaches are fundamentally different. The developer fixed the faulty logic used to generate the test parameters, keeping the test dynamic and adding a new case. The LLM bypassed the faulty logic by hardcoding the expected outcomes for the original inputs, failing to fix the underlying conversion issue or include the new test case.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: dev_miku_r2dbc_mysql_codec_SetCodecTest_stringifySet
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added a new test case. Modified the `stringifyParameters` method to remove the `ArrayUtils.reverse` call and potentially remove a leading '0' from the hex representation. Modified the `binaryParameters` method to call a new helper method `encode` which appears to only encode the first 64 bits of the BitSet by calling `LongCodecTest.encode`.
• LLM changed: Removed the `ArrayUtils.reverse` import and usage. Implemented a new static helper method `toBigEndianBytes` that converts any `BitSet` into a minimal big-endian byte array, handling the empty case specifically. Used this new helper method consistently in both `stringifyParameters` (before hex encoding) and `binaryParameters`.
• Similarity: Both fixes removed the original pattern of using `toByteArray()` followed by `ArrayUtils.reverse`. However, their replacements are significantly different. The LLM implemented a general and correct method for converting a BitSet to big-endian bytes, which addresses the core issue of byte representation directly. The developer used a different approach that seems to only handle BitSets fitting within a single long and modified stringification differently, which is less general and potentially incorrect for the overall BitSet codec logic. The LLM's approach is a more standard and likely correct way to represent a BitSet as big-endian bytes compared to the developer's apparent approach.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: io_prometheus_client_dropwizard_samplebuilder_CustomMappingSampleBuilderTest_test_WHEN_MoreToFormatInLabelsAndName_THEN_ShouldReturnCorrectSample
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer changed the data structure used for the `labels` map in two test methods from `LinkedHashMap` to `HashMap`. This makes the tests less sensitive to the order of label insertion.
• LLM changed: The LLM changed the assertion logic, replacing `assertEquals` with a new helper method `assertSampleEquals`. This helper method compares `Collector.MetricFamilySamples.Sample` objects by ensuring the metric name, label map (ignoring order), and value are equal.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer addressed potential flakiness by changing the type of Map used in the test setup, while the LLM addressed flakiness by changing how the test result is compared, making the comparison of sample labels order-independent.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: org_apache_bookkeeper_slogger_SloggerTest_testMap
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced the use of `HashMap` with `LinkedHashMap` in the test setup.
• LLM changed: Modified the test assertion to use `allOf(containsString("1=3"), containsString("2=4"))` instead of an exact string match, making the assertion order-independent.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer fixed the flakiness by changing the data structure used in the test to one that preserves order (`LinkedHashMap`). The LLM fixed the flakiness by changing the assertion to be tolerant of any order. While both resolve the same flakiness issue, their code changes and methods are entirely dissimilar.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: org_apache_druid_discovery_BaseNodeRoleWatcherTest_testGeneralUseSimulation
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified the test setup to include the `injector` when instantiating the `MSQTestTaskActionClient` spy, suggesting a dependency or initialization issue within the client was the cause of flakiness.
• LLM changed: The LLM added a helper method `sortRows` to `MSQTestBase` and used it to sort both the expected and actual result rows before assertion in `IngestTester` and `SelectTester`. This approach aims to fix flakiness caused by non-deterministic ordering of results.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer addressed a potential dependency/initialization problem in a specific client used by the test, while the LLM addressed a potential non-deterministic output ordering issue by sorting the results before comparison. They target different root causes of flakiness.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: org_apache_ignite_internal_storage_rocksdb_RocksDbMvPartitionStorageTest_commitAndAbortWriteNoOpIfNoUncommittedVersionExists
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer changed the method call from `table.createPartition(0)` to `table.getOrCreateMvPartition(0)` in the `@BeforeEach` setup method. This changes how the partition storage instance is obtained, likely ensuring it exists and is ready for use, addressing a potential timing or existence issue.
• LLM changed: The LLM removed static imports for `DEFAULT_DATA_REGION_NAME` and Hamcrest's `equalTo`. It also removed an assertion that checked if the data region name of the storage configuration was equal to `DEFAULT_DATA_REGION_NAME`. The LLM's fix targets a potentially brittle assertion about configuration defaults.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely dissimilar. The developer changed the core logic for obtaining a partition storage instance, while the LLM removed an unrelated assertion about configuration details. They address different parts of the test setup and different potential causes of flakiness.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: org_apache_servicecomb_service_center_client_ServiceCenterClientTest_TestRegisterServiceInstance
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added the `ArgumentMatchers` import. For the `postHttpRequest` and the relevant `putHttpRequest` mock calls, the developer replaced the specific `objectMapper.writeValueAsString(...)` argument with `Mockito.anyString()`. They also explicitly used `ArgumentMatchers.eq()` for the other arguments (URL path and null body) in these modified mock setups to ensure precise matching for those arguments while allowing any string for the body. The first `putHttpRequest` mock in the third test was left unchanged as it did not involve a generated string body.
• LLM changed: Replaced the specific `objectMapper.writeValueAsString(...)` argument with `Mockito.anyString()` for the `postHttpRequest` calls. Used `Mockito.eq()` for the URL path and `Mockito.isNull()` for the null body arguments in these mock setups. In the third test (`TestSendHeartBeats`), the LLM replaced *both* original `putHttpRequest` mocks with a single, broad mock matching `Mockito.anyString()`, `Mockito.any()`, and `Mockito.any()` for any call to `putHttpRequest`. The LLM did not add a specific `ArgumentMatchers` import, likely relying on static imports from `Mockito`.
• Similarity: The core change addressing the flakiness – replacing the specific generated JSON string with `Mockito.anyString()` – is identical in approach for the first two tests (`TestRegistryService` and `TestRegisterServiceInstance`) and also correctly applied to the second mock in the third test (`TestSendHeartBeats`) by the developer. The LLM also applied `anyString` in the first two tests and the second part of the third test. The main difference lies in the LLM's handling of the third test where it incorrectly combined two distinct mocks into one overly broad mock. However, the fundamental fix pattern for the identified flakiness point (the string argument) is the same as the developer's in the relevant instances. The similarity in addressing the flaky string argument constitutes the majority of the fix's intent and changes.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: org_apache_servicecomb_service_center_client_ServiceCenterClientTest_TestRegistryService
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced the exact serialized string arguments in three `Mockito.when` calls with `Mockito.anyString()` to avoid flakiness caused by serialization differences. Used `ArgumentMatchers.eq` for the URL and `null` arguments to ensure specific endpoints were matched. Added an `ArgumentMatchers` import.
• LLM changed: Replaced the exact serialized string arguments in the same three `Mockito.when` calls with `Mockito.anyString()`. Used `Mockito.eq` for the URL argument and `Mockito.any()` for the second parameter (which was `null`), effectively achieving the same matching logic in this context.
• Similarity: Both fixes correctly identified the cause of flakiness (matching the exact serialized request body string) and applied the standard Mockito solution (`Mockito.anyString()`). Both also retained the necessary specific matching for the endpoint URL. The approach is highly similar, differing only in the specific argument matcher (`ArgumentMatchers.eq(null)` vs `Mockito.any()`) used for the null parameter, which does not impact the core fix.

Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added `ArgumentMatchers` import. Replaced the serialized object body (`objectMapper.writeValueAsString(...)` or `mapper.writeValueAsString(...)`) in three `Mockito.when` calls (`postHttpRequest` and the second `putHttpRequest`) with `Mockito.anyString()`. Explicitly used `ArgumentMatchers.eq()` for the URL and null arguments in these modified mocks.
• LLM changed: Replaced the serialized object body (`objectMapper.writeValueAsString(...)` or `mapper.writeValueAsString(...)`) in the two `postHttpRequest` mocks with `Mockito.anyString()`. Replaced the serialized body in the second `putHttpRequest` mock with `Mockito.any()`. Replaced the `null` arguments in all three modified mocks and the first `putHttpRequest` mock (which the developer did not change) with `Mockito.any()`. Added `Mockito.eq()` for the URL arguments in all four mocks.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that the flakiness was caused by the serialization logic being used in the mock expectations and replaced it with a flexible Mockito argument matcher (`anyString()` or `any()`). Both also correctly used `eq()` for the URL parameters. The core approach to fix the flakiness is highly similar. The differences are minor: the LLM used `any()` for nulls instead of the more specific `eq(null)`, used `any()` instead of `anyString()` for the body in one case, and unnecessarily modified a mock that wasn't related to the serialization flakiness. However, the primary fix is identical.

Test Case: org_apache_shardingsphere_shardingjdbc_jdbc_core_statement_EncryptPreparedStatementTest_assertDeleteWithExecute
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer updated import paths and property access method names (`getProperties` to `getProps`), and crucially changed how the connection was obtained in the `assertResultSet` helper method from specifically targeting "H2" to getting the first available connection from the test setup's map. The developer also removed three test methods (`assertQueryWithNull`, `assertQueryWithEmptyString`, `assertSelectWithInOperator`, `assertSelectWithPlainColumnForContainsColumn`).
• LLM changed: The LLM changed the assertion for a generated key from checking for a specific value (`is(6)`) to checking if it's positive (`> 0`). The LLM also corrected the loops used for asserting `ResultSetMetaData` column labels in multiple test methods (`assertSelectWithMetaData`, `assertSelectWithInOperator`, `assertSelectWithPlainColumnForContainsColumn`), removing redundant checks within a loop. The LLM did not change the connection retrieval logic or remove the test methods the developer removed.
• Similarity: The developer's main fix for potential flakiness involves changing the connection retrieval logic in `assertResultSet` to be less database-specific, which the LLM completely missed. The LLM focused on a different potential flakiness source (generated key value) and also made code improvements to how metadata is asserted in tests, changes not made by the developer. The approaches and the specific critical changes are significantly different.

Test Case: org_apache_shardingsphere_shardingjdbc_jdbc_core_statement_EncryptPreparedStatementTest_assertInsertWithBatchExecute
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer removed several test methods (`assertQueryWithNull`, `assertQueryWithEmptyString`, `assertSelectWithInOperator`, `assertSelectWithPlainColumnForContainsColumn`), removed unused SQL constants, updated the way database properties are accessed due to a likely refactoring (changing property class and method name), and changed how connections are acquired to be less dependent on a specific database type (H2).
• LLM changed: The LLM changed character literals (e.g., `'a'`) to string literals (e.g., `"a"`) when setting parameters using `setObject`. It also simplified `assertThat` loops iterating over result set columns into individual `assertThat` calls for each expected column index in some of the test methods.
• Similarity: The changes made by the developer and the LLM are completely different. The developer's fix involved removing tests and updating environment/dependency-related code, while the LLM's fix focused on parameter types and assertion style within existing test methods. The LLM did not perform any of the key changes the developer made to address the flakiness.

Test Case: org_apache_shardingsphere_shardingjdbc_jdbc_core_statement_EncryptPreparedStatementTest_assertInsertWithExecute
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer removed four entire test methods (`assertQueryWithNull`, `assertQueryWithEmptyString`, `assertSelectWithInOperator`, `assertSelectWithPlainColumnForContainsColumn`), updated import statements and constant usage due to refactoring, and changed the logic for obtaining a database connection in `assertResultSet` to be less dependent on a specific database type ("H2").
• LLM changed: The LLM modified assertions within existing tests. It changed the generated key check from a fixed value (`6`) to checking if the key is positive (`> 0`) in `assertInsertWithExecuteWithGeneratedKey`. It also slightly refactored the loops checking column labels in `assertSelectWithMetaData`, `assertSelectWithInOperator`, and `assertSelectWithPlainColumnForContainsColumn` to directly assert specific column indices instead of iterating through the count.
• Similarity: The changes are almost entirely dissimilar. The developer's fix primarily involved removing problematic test cases and making the database connection retrieval more generic. The LLM's fix involved modifying specific assertions within tests that the developer either kept or removed. The LLM did not remove any tests or modify the connection logic as the developer did.

Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated dependency imports and property lookup constants, made the connection acquisition in `assertResultSet` more generic (less dependent on "H2"), and removed three test methods (`assertQueryWithNull`, `assertQueryWithEmptyString`, `assertSelectWithInOperator`, `assertSelectWithPlainColumnForContainsColumn`) and their associated SQL constants.
• LLM changed: Modified assertions in three specific test methods (`assertSelectWithMetaData`, `assertSelectWithInOperator`, `assertSelectWithPlainColumnForContainsColumn`) to simplify the assertion structure and make column label comparisons case-insensitive.
• Similarity: The fixes are entirely different. The developer removed tests and updated dependencies/setup logic, while the LLM attempted to fix assertions within tests (including tests that the developer removed). There is no overlap in the code changes made to address the flakiness.

Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated imports and property access, made the test database connection acquisition generic rather than H2-specific, and removed three test methods entirely.
• LLM changed: Modified the assertion logic within three test methods (two of which were removed by the developer) to remove redundant checks inside loops and perform single assertions outside the loops.
• Similarity: The changes are significantly different. The developer's fix addressed potential flakiness related to the test setup, database type specificity, and removed apparently problematic test cases. The LLM's fix only addressed a stylistic/correctness issue in how assertions were written within loops in specific test methods, missing the broader issues the developer addressed.

Test Case: org_apache_sling_servlets_get_impl_helpers_JsonRendererTest_testBooleansWithTidy
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified the `testBooleansNoTidy` and `testBooleansWithTidy` methods to use `JSONAssert.assertEquals` instead of the standard `assertEquals`. This allows for semantic comparison of the JSON strings, ignoring potential differences in key order or whitespace which can cause flakiness with strict string comparison. An import for `JSONAssert` was added.
• LLM changed: Modified the `testBooleansNoTidy` and `testBooleansWithTidy` methods to parse both the expected and actual JSON strings into `javax.json.JsonObject`s and then compare the objects using `assertEquals`. This also achieves a semantic comparison of the JSON structure. The LLM also modified the `testECMA` method, adding date parsing logic to make the assertion about the created date less dependent on locale or timezone, which was a different potential source of flakiness not addressed by the developer's fix.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM identified and addressed the flakiness issue in the `testBooleansNoTidy` and `testBooleansWithTidy` methods related to strict JSON string comparison. However, they used different technical approaches to achieve semantic JSON comparison (`JSONAssert` vs. parsing to `JsonObject` and comparing). The LLM also identified and fixed a different flaky test (`testECMA`) in the same file, which the developer did not address in the provided diff. The LLM's fix for the boolean tests involved more significant code changes (parsing logic) compared to the developer's simpler change of the assertion method call.

Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced `HashSet` with `LinkedHashSet` to ensure consistent iteration order, and updated the assertions for the parameter bindings and the generated script string to match the new predictable order.
• LLM changed: Replaced `HashSet` with `LinkedHashSet`.
• Similarity: The LLM made the critical change of using `LinkedHashSet` to address the non-deterministic order issue, which was also the core change made by the developer. However, the LLM failed to update the subsequent assertions for the parameter bindings and the generated script string, which is necessary because the change to `LinkedHashSet` alters the expected order of elements. The developer correctly updated these assertions. The LLM's fix is incomplete as it doesn't update the expected outputs.

• LLM changed: Replaced `HashMap` with `LinkedHashMap` in the same two test methods (`shouldConvertMapToIterator` and `shouldConvertMapToList`) to ensure predictable iteration order, and added the necessary `LinkedHashMap` import.
• Similarity: The changes made by the developer and the LLM are identical. Both correctly identified that the non-deterministic order of `HashMap` was causing flakiness and fixed it by using `LinkedHashMap`, which preserves insertion order.

• LLM changed: Replaced `HashMap` with `LinkedHashMap` in the same two test methods and added the import for `LinkedHashMap` (while keeping the import for `HashMap`).
• Similarity: The core fix (using `LinkedHashMap` instead of `HashMap` to ensure predictable iteration order) is identical between the developer and the LLM, applied in the same locations. The only difference is in the handling of the `HashMap` import, which the LLM kept but which is not used after the change.

Analysis:
• Developer changed: Corrected an apparent typo in the expected local symmetry key (`"A12C12D12E12F12H2"` changed to `"A12B12C12D12E12H2"`), and changed `keySet().contains()` to `containsKey()` in one assertion. This seems to fix an issue with the test's expected data or how it is checked.
• LLM changed: Modified assertions in two different test methods (`testHelicalLocal` and `testPseudoIdentity95`) to make them less dependent on the order of results returned by the tested code. It replaced index-based access (`.get(0)`) with stream-based searching (`findFirst()`, `anyMatch()`) to find the desired result.
• Similarity: The fixes are completely different. The developer fixed a potential error in the test data or an assertion key in one specific test method. The LLM changed the assertion logic in two different methods to make them more robust against varying result order, which was not the cause of the flakiness addressed by the developer's fix.

Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Replaced a single assertion checking the entire toString() output string with multiple assertions, each checking for the presence of a specific key-value pair within the string. This makes the test less brittle to changes in field order or the presence of other fields.
• LLM changed: Replaced a single assertion checking the entire toString() output string with multiple assertions, each checking for the presence of a specific key-value pair within the string. The LLM checked a smaller subset of fields compared to the developer.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that checking the entire `toString()` output as a single, rigid string was the cause of flakiness. Both applied the same fix strategy: replacing the single brittle assertion with multiple, more flexible assertions that check for individual components within the string. The primary difference is the number of fields chosen to be verified individually.

Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified an existing test's expected output to include milliseconds ("2001-07-04 12:08:56.000") and added a new test specifically for parsing UTC timestamps with milliseconds ("2020-07-30T15:20:05.424Z") into a `Timestamp`.
• LLM changed: Modified a helper method (`getDate`) used within the test class by removing manual appending of a timezone (" PDT"), setting the `SimpleDateFormat`'s timezone explicitly to "UTC", and initializing it in a static block. This aims to make the test helper timezone-independent.
• Similarity: The fixes address related issues (timestamps and timezones) but target different parts of the code and use different approaches. The developer added/modified test cases focusing on the code under test (`ParsePrimitiveUtils`), while the LLM fixed a potentially flawed helper method (`getDate`) used *by* the tests, addressing a common source of flakiness (timezone dependence in test setup). The changes are not similar in implementation or scope.
----------------------------------------

Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified an existing test assertion to include milliseconds in the expected output (`"2001-07-04 12:08:56"` -> `"2001-07-04 12:08:56.000"`) and added a new test method specifically for parsing timestamps with milliseconds in UTC.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified a static helper method (`getDate`) within the test class (`JsonSerDeTimeStampTest`) that was used to generate timestamps for tests. It changed the `SimpleDateFormat` configuration to use UTC explicitly and removed hardcoded "PDT" appending, making the timestamp parsing deterministic regardless of the host's timezone.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer fixed the test's expected output and added a new test case. The LLM fixed a test helper method that was likely causing flakiness due to timezone dependency in test data setup. They addressed different code sections and tackled different potential causes of flakiness based on the provided diffs.

Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer changed the logging framework used, switching from SLF4J (`org.slf4j`) to Apache Commons Logging (`org.apache.commons.logging`). This involved changing imports and the logger variable declaration.
• LLM changed: The LLM changed the method used to retrieve the inserted person by ID. Instead of using a general `selectOne` method with a `Query` and `Criteria`, it used the more specific `selectOneById` method. It also removed the imports for `Criteria` and `Query`.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer focused on the logging implementation, while the LLM focused on the data access query method. There is no overlap in the code modified or the apparent approach to fixing the issue.

• LLM changed: Modified the class to make the ID generation strategy configurable. It introduced a `Supplier<String>` for generating IDs and added a public static method to override this supplier, facilitating the use of deterministic IDs in tests.
• Similarity: The developer's fix addressed logging implementation details, while the LLM's fix addressed the randomness of ID generation to improve testability. The changes are completely different in their focus and implementation.

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_config_RepositoryRestMvConfigurationIntegrationTests_
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified one assertion for the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW_METHODS` header in a test method. Instead of asserting the exact string value, the developer retrieved the header, split it by comma, and used AssertJ's `containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf` to compare the methods against a known list of default allowed methods, making the assertion independent of the order of methods in the header.
• LLM changed: Modified multiple assertions for the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW_METHODS` header across several test methods. Instead of asserting the exact string value, the LLM used Hamcrest's `allOf(containsString(...))` matcher to check if the header string contained all the expected method names, effectively making the assertion independent of the order of methods in the header. The LLM also added a comment explaining the fix.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that the flakiness was caused by the assertion expecting the methods in the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header to be in a specific order. Both fixes addressed this by changing the assertion logic to ignore the order of the methods listed in the header string. Although they used different libraries/matchers (developer used AssertJ on a split string, LLM used Hamcrest's `allOf` on the original string), the core approach of making the assertion order-independent is the same and effectively fixes the flakiness due to header order. The LLM also applied this fix to multiple occurrences of the same flaky assertion pattern.
----------------------------------------

Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified the assertion for the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header in one test (`appliesSelectiveDefaultCorsConfiguration`). Instead of checking for an exact string match (which depends on order), they retrieved the header value, split it by comma, and asserted that the resulting list of methods contained exactly the methods defined by `RepositoryRestHandlerMapping.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS` in any order.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified the assertions for the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header in multiple tests within the file. It replaced the exact string match assertion with a Hamcrest `allOf` matcher containing multiple `containsString` matchers for each expected method. This allows the assertion to pass regardless of the order of methods in the header string.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that the flakiness was caused by the order of the comma-separated methods in the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. Both implemented solutions that make the assertion order-independent. The developer's approach was slightly more specific by comparing against a framework constant, while the LLM used a more general Hamcrest matching approach applied to the string content directly. The core strategy to handle the order flakiness is the same.

Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer changed the assertion on the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. Instead of asserting an exact string match, the developer retrieved the header value, split it by comma, and used AssertJ's `containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf` assertion to verify that the resulting set of methods exactly matches the expected default methods defined in `RepositoryRestHandlerMapping`, ignoring their order.
• LLM changed: The LLM also changed the assertion on the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. Instead of an exact string match, the LLM replaced the assertion with multiple `andExpect` calls, each using the `containsString` matcher to check if the header string contains each expected method ("GET", "HEAD", "POST", etc.) individually. The LLM applied this pattern to several similar assertions in other test methods.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that the flakiness was due to the assertion relying on the exact order of methods in the header string. Both attempted to fix this by changing the assertion logic to be order-independent. However, their approaches differed significantly: the developer used a more robust method of parsing the header into a set and comparing it against a known application constant, while the LLM used a simpler, less precise method of checking for the presence of individual substrings. While the goal was similar, the implementation strategy and the correctness of the fix were different.

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_RepositoryRestHandlerMappingUnitTests_handlesCorsPreflightRequestsProperly
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified the `appliesSelectiveDefaultCorsConfiguration` test. Instead of directly matching the exact header string order, the developer retrieved the header value, split it by commas, and used AssertJ's `assertThat().containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf()` to compare the methods against the application's default allowed methods (`RepositoryRestHandlerMapping.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS`), making the test robust against header order variations.
• LLM changed: Modified four similar test methods. In each, it replaced the direct string comparison in the `header().string(...)` assertion with a Hamcrest `allOf(containsString(...), containsString(...), ...)` matcher. This makes the assertion pass as long as the required methods are present in the header string, regardless of their order.
• Similarity: Both fixes address the same flakiness issue related to the unpredictable order of methods in the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header string. They both achieve order-independence in the assertion. However, the developer's fix is more specific (checking for the exact set of expected methods) and uses a different assertion style (retrieving and comparing a parsed list), while the LLM's fix uses Hamcrest matchers within the existing assertion structure and checks only for the presence of the expected methods (potentially allowing others). The implementation approaches, while targeting the same problem, are quite different.

Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified one test method (`appliesSelectiveDefaultCorsConfiguration`) to capture the header value, split it, and assert that the resulting methods array contains exactly the methods defined by `RepositoryRestHandlerMapping.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS` in any order, using `assertThat` and `containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf`.
• LLM changed: Modified multiple test methods to change the assertion for `HttpHeaders.ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` from an exact string match or simple `containsString` to `allOf(containsString(...), ...)` for each expected method. This checks that all required methods are present, regardless of order.
• Similarity: Both fixes address the flakiness caused by the indeterminate order of comma-separated methods in the CORS header string. They both make the assertion order-insensitive. However, the implementation differs: the developer uses `assertThat` with `containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf` against the split header value, referencing a constant, while the LLM uses `allOf(containsString(...))` for each method against the raw header string, hardcoding the expected methods in each test. The developer's fix is more precise (checking for exact set) and potentially more maintainable (referencing a constant). The LLM applied its approach to all relevant tests, while the developer's diff shows only one test modified.

Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified one test case to retrieve the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header, split it by comma, and assert that the resulting set of methods exactly matches the default allowed methods from a framework class (`RepositoryRestHandlerMapping.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS`), using AssertJ's `containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf` to ensure the exact set of methods is present regardless of order.
• LLM changed: Modified multiple test cases to change the assertion on the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. Instead of checking for an exact string or a specific substring order, it checks that the header string contains each expected method individually using Hamcrest's `allOf` combined with `containsString` matchers.
• Similarity: Both recognized that the test was flaky because the assertion required a specific order for methods in the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. Both fixed this by making the assertion order-independent. However, the developer used a more precise method (checking for the exact set of methods after splitting the string, tied to framework constants) while the LLM used a less precise method (checking for containment of individual method names within the string) and applied the fix pattern to more test cases than shown in the developer's snippet. The underlying approach to fixing the order issue is similar, but the implementation details and the precision of the check differ significantly.

Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified the assertion for the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header in one test case. Instead of asserting the exact string order, the developer retrieved the header value, split it by commas, and used `assertThat().containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf()` to verify that the resulting list contained the expected method names regardless of their order. The developer also referenced a constant for the expected methods, improving maintainability.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified the assertion for the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header in multiple test cases. It replaced the assertion for an exact string match with an assertion using Hamcrest's `allOf(containsString(...))` matchers, checking that the header string contains all the required method names.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM identified that the flakiness likely stemmed from the order of methods in the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header string. Both attempted to make the test resilient to changes in this order. However, their approaches are significantly different: the developer used a more robust method of parsing the header value into a collection and asserting the presence of elements in any order, while the LLM used simpler string matching with `containsString`. The developer's solution is a more precise and idiomatic way to handle unordered collections in assertions.

Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified one test method's assertion for the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header. Instead of an exact string match, it now captures the header value, splits it by comma, and uses AssertJ's `assertThat().containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf()` to compare against the framework's default allowed methods (obtained programmatically), ensuring the check is order-independent. Added relevant imports.
• LLM changed: Modified the assertions for the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header in four different test methods. Instead of an exact string match using `header().string(...)`, it now uses Hamcrest's `allOf()` combined with `containsString()` for each expected method (e.g., `allOf(containsString("GET"), containsString("HEAD"), containsString("POST"))`), ensuring the check is order-independent.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM identified the same core issue: the test was flaky because it expected the comma-separated methods in the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header to be in a specific order. Both fixed this by changing the assertion to check for the presence of the required methods regardless of their order. While the specific implementation details differ (developer used AssertJ and split the string vs. LLM used Hamcrest `allOf` and `containsString`), the underlying approach to making the assertion order-independent is very similar. The LLM also correctly identified and applied this fix to multiple instances of the same problem pattern across the test class, which is not shown in the provided developer diff but indicates a good understanding of the issue's scope.

Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified the assertion for the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header. Instead of asserting an exact string match which is order-dependent, the developer retrieved the header value, split it by comma, and used `assertThat().containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf()` to check if the resulting methods match the expected set, ignoring the order.
• LLM changed: Modified the assertions for the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header across multiple test methods. Instead of asserting an exact string match, the LLM replaced the single assertion with multiple `containsString()` assertions, checking that each expected method (`GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, etc.) is present somewhere within the header string.
• Similarity: Both fixes address the flakiness caused by the potential for the order of methods in the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header to vary. They both relax the strict string matching requirement to allow for different orderings. The developer's approach is more robust as it verifies the exact set of allowed methods regardless of order, whereas the LLM's approach only checks for the presence of expected methods (and doesn't strictly exclude others, though in this context that's likely not an issue). The core goal of handling order variations is the same.

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_RepositoryRestHandlerMappingUnitTests_resolvesCorsConfigurationFromRequestUri
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Captured the value of the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header, split it, and used an AssertJ assertion (`containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf`) to check if the resulting list of methods matched the framework's default allowed methods, regardless of their order. This fix was applied to one specific test method.
• LLM changed: Modified the Hamcrest assertion for the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header across several test methods. Instead of checking for an exact string or simple substring, it used `allOf` combined with multiple `containsString` matchers to verify that the header contained the required method names as substrings.
• Similarity: Both fixes addressed the potential flakiness caused by the order of methods in the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. However, their approaches were significantly different. The developer's fix involved extracting and processing the header value before using a more precise assertion library (AssertJ) linked to the application's defaults, whereas the LLM's fix stayed within the existing Hamcrest framework using a less precise substring check applied more broadly across tests.

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_RepositoryRestHandlerMappingUnitTests_returnsNullForUriNotMapped
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added imports for AssertJ, HttpMethod, and RepositoryRestHandlerMapping. In the first test, the developer changed the assertion for the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header to explicitly retrieve the header value, split it by comma, and assert that the resulting collection contains the default allowed HttpMethods from the framework's RepositoryRestHandlerMapping in any order using AssertJ.
• LLM changed: Replaced the Hamcrest `string` matcher with `allOf` containing multiple `containsString` matchers for the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header assertion in all three test methods. This checks if the header string contains all the expected method names regardless of their order.
• Similarity: Both fixes address the flakiness caused by the uncertain order of methods in the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header. However, they use different approaches: the developer's fix for the first test is more specific by retrieving and asserting against the exact collection of default methods using AssertJ, while the LLM's fix uses a simpler Hamcrest matcher pattern (`allOf`/`containsString`) to check for the presence of expected method strings, applying it more broadly to all relevant assertions. The core mechanism for handling the order difference is different.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_RepositoryRestHandlerMappingUnitTests_returnsRepositoryHandlerMethodForAbsoluteBaseUri
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified one specific test method to capture the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header value, split it into an array of method names, and assert that this array contains exactly the elements from a known constant set (`RepositoryRestHandlerMapping.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS`) in any order, making the test robust to order changes and potential changes in the default allowed methods.
• LLM changed: Modified multiple test methods that assert the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. Instead of asserting an exact string, it used a Hamcrest `allOf` matcher combined with `containsString` matchers for each expected method name. This makes the test resilient to the order of methods in the header string.
• Similarity: Both fixes address the flakiness caused by the order of methods in the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. They both replace a strict string equality check with a more flexible assertion that ignores the order of the listed methods. The LLM applied its fix pattern across multiple tests, while the developer's provided diff shows a more robust method of checking against a constant set for a single test. Both approaches effectively fix the core flakiness issue.

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_RepositoryRestHandlerMappingUnitTests_returnsRepositoryHandlerMethodWithBaseUriConfigured
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified the test to capture the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header value, split it into individual methods, and then used `assertThat(...).containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf(...)` to assert that the resulting list of methods exactly matches the expected set, regardless of their order. This involved adding imports for `Assertions` and `HttpMethod`, and referencing a known set of default methods from `RepositoryRestHandlerMapping`.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified multiple test methods. It replaced the single `header().string(..., "exact string")` assertion with multiple `header().string(..., containsString("method"))` assertions for each expected method. This checks that each expected method is present in the header string, making the assertion independent of the order of methods in the header.
• Similarity: Both fixes address the flakiness caused by the order of methods in the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header. Both make the assertion order-independent. However, their implementations differ: the developer parses the string and uses a collection assertion for an exact set match, which is more robust. The LLM uses multiple string containment checks on the raw header string, which is less precise (doesn't guarantee *only* the expected methods are present) but still resolves the order issue. The developer's approach is more idiomatic Java/AssertJ for this type of assertion. The LLM's change is a valid, but less ideal, way to address the same problem.

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_RepositoryRestHandlerMappingUnitTests_returnsRootHandlerMethodWithBaseUriConfigured
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified one specific test method (`appliesSelectiveDefaultCorsConfiguration`) to extract the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header value and use AssertJ's `containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf` assertion to check if the methods present match the expected set (derived from `RepositoryRestHandlerMapping.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS`), regardless of their order. This required adding imports for AssertJ and `HttpMethod`.
• LLM changed: Modified four different test methods (`appliesSelectiveDefaultCorsConfiguration`, `appliesGlobalCorsConfiguration`, `appliesCorsConfigurationOnRepository`, `appliesCorsConfigurationOnRepositoryToCustomControllers`) by replacing the single exact string match assertion for the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header with multiple `containsString` assertions, one for each expected method. This approach addresses the flakiness caused by the order of methods in the header string.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM identified the flakiness was related to the exact string matching of the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header where the order of methods could vary. Both proposed solutions that make the test resilient to method order. However, their approaches differ significantly: the developer used a precise assertion (`containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf`) against a known source of truth (`DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS`) in one test, while the LLM used a simpler heuristic (`containsString` for each expected method) and applied it to multiple tests. The LLM did not replicate the developer's more robust assertion logic or reference the constant source of truth.

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_RepositoryRestHandlerMappingUnitTests_stripsBaseUriForCorsConfigurationResolution
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified the assertion for the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header in one test case. Instead of asserting against a fixed string, the developer retrieved the header value, split it by commas, and used AssertJ's `assertThat(...).containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf(...)` to compare the resulting set of methods against a programmatic list of default allowed methods from `RepositoryRestHandlerMapping`, making the assertion order-independent and robust.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified the assertion for the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header in multiple test cases. It replaced the assertion against a fixed string with a Hamcrest assertion using `allOf(containsString(...), ...)`. This checks if the header string contains all expected method names as substrings, which also helps handle order flakiness, but is less precise than checking for an exact set match.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM identified the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS` header assertion as the source of flakiness and aimed to make it order-independent. However, their approaches differed significantly. The developer used a more robust method involving splitting the string and comparing against a programmatic source of truth using set comparison, while the LLM used a less precise method checking for substring presence with hardcoded values. The LLM also applied its fix to more locations than shown in the developer's diff.

Test Case: org_springframework_data_rest_webmvc_RepositoryRestHandlerMappingUnitTests_twoArgumentConstructorDoesNotThrowException
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: PARTIAL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified one test method to extract the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header value, split it into a list, and use AssertJ's `containsExactlyInAnyOrderElementsOf` to assert that the list matches a set of expected methods derived from a framework constant (`RepositoryRestHandlerMapping.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS`). This change makes the test robust against the order of methods in the header.
• LLM changed: Modified six test methods that asserted against the `ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-METHODS` header. In each case, it replaced the strict string equality assertion with a Hamcrest `allOf` matcher combined with `containsString` for each expected method (e.g., changing `"GET,HEAD,POST"` to `allOf(containsString("GET"), containsString("HEAD"), containsString("POST"))`). This change also makes the assertions robust against the order of methods.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that the test was flaky because it relied on the specific order of methods in the CORS header string. Both implemented fixes that ensure the presence of the required methods regardless of their order. However, their approaches differ significantly in implementation details (AssertJ+split vs. Hamcrest matchers) and scope (developer fixed one test using a framework constant; LLM applied a generic pattern to fix multiple tests).

Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added a conditional security permission to the deployed archive's `permissions.xml` specifically for IBM JDKs to allow access to internal JAXP classes required by `SOAPFactory.newInstance()`.
• LLM changed: Modified the test class to use parameter injection for `@ArquillianResource URL baseUrl` instead of field injection, and added logic to safely construct the WSDL URL in the `@Before` method.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer addressed a security permission issue specific to certain JDKs within the deployed application, while the LLM addressed potential issues with how the base URL was obtained and used in the test setup.

Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added a conditional check for the Java vendor (`SystemUtils.JAVA_VENDOR`). If running on an IBM JDK, it adds a specific `accessClassInPackage` runtime permission to the deployment's `permissions.xml` to allow access to internal JAXP classes, addressing a security issue specific to that environment.
• LLM changed: Modified how the WSDL URL is constructed, ensuring a '/' separator between the base URL and the service path. It checks if the base URL string ends with '/' and adds it if necessary before appending the service path. This attempts to fix potential issues with URL formation.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer addressed a security permission issue specific to the IBM JDK, while the LLM attempted to fix a potential URL construction problem. They target unrelated causes of flakiness.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: org_wildfly_extension_undertow_UndertowSubsystem70TestCase_testRuntime
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer made the addition of `permissions.xml` conditional on the Java vendor being IBM. For the IBM JDK, they changed the specific permission added from `getClassLoader` to `accessClassInPackage.com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp`. This targets a specific security manager issue encountered on the IBM JDK.
• LLM changed: The LLM completely removed the line that added the `permissions.xml` resource and its associated comment. The LLM's change removes the security manager permission requirement entirely.
• Similarity: The fixes are completely different. The developer addressed a platform-specific (IBM JDK) security manager permission issue by changing the permission required. The LLM removed the permission requirement altogether, which is a different approach and might not resolve the underlying platform-specific flakiness the developer targeted.

Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added a conditional block using `SystemUtils.JAVA_VENDOR` to provide a different security permission (`accessClassInPackage`) when running on IBM JDKs. This permission is needed for `SOAPFactory.newInstance()` invocation under security manager on IBM JDKs. The original `getClassLoader` permission is applied otherwise.
• LLM changed: Modified the WSDL URL path in the `@Before` method, removing the leading slash from `/jaxws-basic-pojo/POJOService?wsdl` to `jaxws-basic-pojo/POJOService?wsdl`.

Test Case: rg_apache_cloudstack_api_command_test_ResetVMUserDataCmdTest_testUserdataDetails
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer changed the assertion from comparing the `toString()` representation of the maps to comparing the map objects directly using `Assert.assertEquals(Map, Map)`. This avoids flakiness caused by the inconsistent order of elements in the string representation of a HashMap.
• LLM changed: The LLM corrected an error in the test setup where keys intended for `values2` were incorrectly added to `values1`. It also changed the assertion from comparing `toString()` representations to comparing map objects directly. The LLM created an explicit `expected` map to hold the merged result and compared the actual result against this `expected` map.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM identified and fixed the primary cause of flakiness, which was comparing the order-dependent string representations of maps. They both resolved this by changing the assertion to perform a direct comparison of map contents using `Assert.assertEquals(Map, Map)`. The LLM's fix was more comprehensive as it also corrected an issue in the test's data setup.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: spoon_support_visitor_java_JavaReflectionTreeBuilderTest_testPurelyReflectiveInnerClass
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer changed the assertion for the first field's simple name from `assertEquals("element", ...)` to `assertTrue("element".contains(...) || "other".contains(...))`. This indicates the flakiness was caused by the order of fields returned by reflection (`getFields()`) not being guaranteed, and the test expected "element" to always be the first field, whereas sometimes "other" might be first. The fix allows either "element" or "other" as the first field name.
• LLM changed: The LLM also addressed the field order issue in the same test (`testInnerClassOfSourceCodeClass`). Instead of checking only the first field, it changed the assertion to `assertTrue(stream(ctClass.getFields()).anyMatch(f -> "element".equals(f.getSimpleName())))`. This checks if *any* field is named "element", regardless of order. The LLM also applied this same fix to another related test (`testPurelyReflectiveInnerClass`) and made other changes in different tests (explicitly filtering interfaces, finding anonymous types) that might also address potential flakiness points elsewhere in the file.
• Similarity: Both fixes successfully identified the source of flakiness related to field order in the `testInnerClassOfSourceCodeClass` method. While their *specific approach* to the assertion differs (developer checks the first field against two options, LLM checks all fields for one specific option), they both correctly resolve the non-deterministic nature of field order from reflection. The LLM's fix is arguably more robust for the field name "element" as it doesn't depend on its position, and it correctly applied a similar fix to a related test method as well. The LLM also attempted to improve other parts of the test file.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: spoon_test_comment_CommentTest_testAnnotationTypeComment
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Modified the assertions in `testAnnotationTypeComment` to use `assertTrue(...contains(...))` instead of `assertEquals` for comment content, checking if expected comments are present within a concatenated string of all expected comments rather than requiring exact matches in specific list positions. This might address flakiness related to comment order or parsing nuances.
• LLM changed: Modified two other test methods (`testFormatTextComment` and `testJavaDocRawContent`) within the same file. The changes involved normalizing line endings (`\r\n`, `\r` to `\n`) before processing or comparing string content. This addresses flakiness caused by platform-dependent line ending conventions.
• Similarity: The fixes are completely dissimilar. The developer's fix targets the assertion logic for comments in annotations/annotation methods in one specific test. The LLM's fix targets line ending normalization in different tests within the same file, a common source of flakiness but unrelated to the developer's specific change.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: spoon_test_compilation_CompilationTest_testModuleResolution
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified the `testBuildAstWithModules` test method. They changed the assertion logic to iterate through the first two modules returned by `getAllModules()` and assert that the collection contains both "spoonmod" and the "unnamed module", regardless of their iteration order. This fixes flakiness caused by non-deterministic iteration order.
• LLM changed: The LLM provided diffs for `CompilationTest.java` but did *not* modify the `testBuildAstWithModules` method that the developer fixed. Instead, it modified other test methods (`testBuildAstWithSyntheticMethods`, `testBuildAstWithSyntheticMethodsSwapOrder`, and `testExoticClassLoader`) by relaxing assertions related to the number of methods or the content/size of a list, addressing different potential flakiness issues in those specific tests.
• Similarity: The LLM's changes are completely unrelated to the developer's changes for the specific test method shown (`testBuildAstWithModules`). The LLM addressed different tests and different flakiness root causes.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: spoon_test_template_SubstitutionTest_testCreateTypeFromTemplate
Category: ID
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer changed the assertion logic for enum values to be order-independent, accepting the values in either order. They also changed a `HashMap` to a `LinkedHashMap`, potentially to ensure parameter order if that was relevant elsewhere.
• LLM changed: The LLM changed assertions in several *different* test methods within the same file. The LLM's changes focused on comparing Spoon AST elements by their string representation (`toString()`) or by checking specific properties, explicitly stating not to rely on the default `equals()` implementation of these objects, which suggests the LLM identified flakiness related to object comparison.
• Similarity: The fixes are completely different. The developer fixed a specific flakiness related to collection order in one test method (`testEnumSubstitution`). The LLM fixed potential flakiness related to object equality comparisons in several other test methods within the same file. The LLM's fix does not address the specific issue fixed by the developer.

Test Case: com_alibaba_csp_sentinel_TracerTest_setExceptionsToIgnore
Category: OD
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added lines to reset `Tracer.exceptionPredicate`, `Tracer.ignoreClasses`, and `Tracer.traceClasses` to null at the beginning of the `setExceptionsToTrace` and `setExceptionsToIgnore` test methods.
• LLM changed: Added lines to reset `Tracer.ignoreClasses`, `Tracer.traceClasses`, and `Tracer.exceptionPredicate` to null in both the `@Before` (setup) and `@After` (teardown) methods.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that the flakiness was due to shared static state in the `Tracer` class (`exceptionPredicate`, `ignoreClasses`, `traceClasses`) and fixed it by resetting these variables to null. The LLM's approach of resetting in the `@Before` method is a standard and often preferred practice for preventing shared-state flakiness across all tests in a class, achieving the same goal as resetting at the start of individual test methods but more comprehensively. The core issue identified and the mechanism to fix it (nulling the static state variables) are the same.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: com_alibaba_csp_sentinel_TracerTest_setExceptionsToTrace
Category: OD
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: SUCCESS
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added `Tracer.exceptionPredicate = null;` at the beginning of two specific test methods (`setExceptionsToTrace` and `setExceptionsToIgnore`) that were experiencing flakiness.
• LLM changed: Added code to reset multiple static fields in the `Tracer` class (`ignoreClasses`, `traceClasses`, and `exceptionPredicate`) to `null` within the `@Before` (`setUp`) and `@After` (`tearDown`) methods of the test class.
• Similarity: Both the developer and the LLM correctly identified that the flakiness was caused by static state pollution in the `Tracer` class, specifically involving fields like `exceptionPredicate`. Both solutions address this by resetting the relevant static state. The LLM's solution is more comprehensive, resetting multiple fields in the test setup/teardown applied to the entire test class, whereas the developer's fix was more targeted to the specific flaky tests. However, the core approach of identifying and resetting the problematic static state is the same. The LLM's fix is a valid and common pattern for fixing this type of flakiness in test classes.

Test Case: io_kubernetes_client_spring_extended_controller_KubernetesInformerCreatorTest_testInformerInjection
Category: OD
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer refactored the Spring test configuration by replacing `@Import` and `@TestConfiguration` with a nested `@SpringBootApplication` class specified in `@SpringBootTest`. They also removed an explicit `@Bean` definition for `KubernetesInformerConfigurer` (likely relying on auto-configuration or the annotation processor) and added namespace targeting (`namespace = "default"`) to the `@KubernetesInformer` annotation for ConfigMaps, updating WireMock stubs and verifications accordingly.
• LLM changed: The LLM replaced the fixed `Thread.sleep()` with an `Awaitility` block that waits for the specified conditions (WireMock requests verified and lister sizes correct) to be met within a timeout.
• Similarity: The approaches are completely different. The developer fixed issues related to the test's Spring application context setup and specific Kubernetes resource targeting (namespaces). The LLM treated the flakiness as a purely timing-dependent issue, adding a dynamic wait, without addressing the underlying configuration or resource targeting problems the developer solved.
----------------------------------------

Test Case: org_apache_karaf_main_MainLockingTest_testLostMasterLockAfterThreshold
Category: OD
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Added a `Thread.sleep(1000)` after the bundle starts in the original test, cleared the `karaf.lock.lostThreshold` system property in the `@After` method, and added two *new* tests (`testRetainsMasterLockOverFluctuation` and `testLostMasterLockAfterThreshold`) specifically designed to test the lock loss behavior in conjunction with the `karaf.lock.lostThreshold` property, indicating the flakiness might have been related to how quickly lock loss is detected or tolerated.
• LLM changed: Wrapped the core logic of the test methods (`testLostMasterLock`, `testMasterWritesPid`, `testSlaveWritesPid`) within `try...finally` blocks to ensure `main.destroy()` is called for resource cleanup. It also added clearing of `test.karaf.mocklock.initiallyLocked` and `karaf.lock.level` properties in `@Before` and `@After` methods, which were missing cleanup for properties used in a different test (`testSlaveWritesPid`). The LLM did not add the `Thread.sleep` or the new test methods introduced by the developer.
• Similarity: The fixes are largely dissimilar. The developer's fix directly addressed potential timing issues in the lock loss scenario by adding sleep and introducing new tests focused on lock loss thresholds. The LLM's fix focused on general test robustness through resource cleanup (`try...finally`) and more comprehensive property clearing, but did not address the specific flakiness related to the lock logic timing or the threshold mechanism like the developer did.

Test Case: org_apache_ratis_server_impl_TestRetryCacheMetrics_testRetryCacheEntryCount
Category: OD
Developer Fix: --- before.java
Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer updated the target class for setting the logger level in the test setup. This seems to be a change reflecting a refactoring in the Ratis codebase, specifically changing from `RaftServerImpl.LOG` to `RaftServer.Division.LOG`.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified the test logic within the `runTestStream` method. It added code to capture the `CompletableFuture` returned by the final `sendAsync` call and then explicitly called `.get()` on it to wait for that specific asynchronous operation to complete before proceeding with the test. This attempts to fix potential flakiness caused by checking the state before the message stream operation finishes.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer's fix addresses a change in the code's structure (logging target), while the LLM's fix attempts to address a potential timing issue or race condition within the test execution logic itself. They modify different parts of the code and have different purposes.

Rating: FAIL
Analysis:
• Developer changed: Updated the class/target used for setting the log level for the Ratis server from `RaftServerImpl.LOG` to `RaftServer.Division.LOG`, likely due to a refactoring in the Ratis library.
• LLM changed: Added a `@Before` method to reset the `submessageSize` configuration property before each test run, aiming to prevent state leakage and order dependency between tests.
• Similarity: The changes are completely different. The developer's fix updates a logging configuration target due to library evolution, while the LLM's fix attempts to solve flakiness by resetting a test-specific configuration state before each test.

Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified the assertion in the `shouldGetASMVersion` test method to accept multiple starting versions ("5.", "6.", or "7.") instead of just "5.", indicating that the flakiness was due to variations in the underlying library version.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified a different helper method `anyVersion` to return a fixed version ("1.0") instead of a random one. This method does not appear to be used by the flaky test `shouldGetASMVersion`.
• Similarity: The two fixes are completely different. The developer addressed the flakiness within the specific test method by adjusting the expected version range, while the LLM changed an unrelated helper method, seemingly assuming the flakiness was caused by random version generation in a different part of the test class.

Analysis:
• Developer changed: The developer modified the assertion in the `shouldGetASMVersion` test to accept ASM versions starting with "5.", "6.", or "7.", instead of just "5.", acknowledging that newer versions might be used.
• LLM changed: The LLM modified the `shouldGetASMVersion` test by removing the specific version check entirely and replacing it with assertions that the version and version string are not null. It also changed the `anyVersion` helper method to generate version strings using only numeric values, potentially to avoid parsing errors in other tests.
• Similarity: The LLM identified the flakiness in the `shouldGetASMVersion` test and noted the issue of depending on a specific version. However, its fix was completely different from the developer's: the developer expanded the allowed versions while the LLM removed the specific version check altogether and added null checks. The LLM also made an unrelated change to another helper method that the developer did not touch. The approaches are fundamentally different.
